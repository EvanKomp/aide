# AI-assisted Directed Evolution Framework (AIDE)
A modular codebase for integrating current and future AI techniques to expedite directed evolution campaigns.

## Motivation
Directed evolution optimizes proteins for specific properties through iterative mutation and evaluation. Laboratory screening is resource-intensive. This framework aims to incorporate AI methods to reduce the number of evaluations required. A number of strategies have been proposed recently, and thos software aims to integrate them into a single framework.

### Strategies 
1. **In Silico Estimators**: Predict properties to filter low-performing variants.
  - Improved through iterative training.
2. **Uncertainty Estimators**: Act as acquisition functions for exploration-exploitation balance.
3. **Library Generation Tools**: Produce manageable library sizes from vast fitness landscapes.

This framework aggregates these tools and facilitates smooth transitions between lab rounds.
